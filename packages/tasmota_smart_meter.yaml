# This data is sent by an IR reader which reads the SML interfact of a EMH
# ED300S meter and sends the data via a tasmota board and an MQTT message
# broker. Here my tasmota script:
#
# >D
# >B
# ->sensor53 r
# >M 1
# +1,3,s,0,9600,Main
# 1,77070100010800FF@1000,Counter,kWh,counter,0
# #
#
# I don't get the current power from the meter, but only the total counter and
# that value rounded to full kWh, sadly.
