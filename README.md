This repository contains our configuration for [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant). It's a collection of small scripts and fun automations for tinkering around and fun.

## Highlights

- [Christmas switch](automations/christmas_mode.yaml): a physical lightswitch at home with a Christmas tree icon from the plotter dims the lights, switches on the Christmas tree lights, and plays Christmas music on Spotify.
- Temperature and humidity sensors for ESP devices: [BME280](esphome/.sensor.bme280.yaml), [DHT22](esphome/.sensor.dht22.yaml)
- [Waste collection schedule from Abfallwirtschaftsbetrieb MÃ¼nchen (AWM)](packages/waste_collection_schedule.yaml)
- [IKEA Idasen height-adjustable desk](esphome/.sensor.idasen.yaml)

## Naming

You will notice that most devices, rooms, sensors, and other entities have German names in this repository. While this produces weird configuration files, that's an intentional choice given that all interfaces at our home are used in German.
